AD-RiskGenePredictor is an open-source framework integrating Mendelian Randomization (MR), Differential Expression Analysis, and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) with multi-algorithm machine learning to identify causally relevant genes and construct an early diagnostic model for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD).

This pipeline enables:

Discovery of core AD risk genes through causal inference and network biology.

Functional annotation via GO/KEGG enrichment and immune infiltration profiling.

Feature selection across eight machine learning algorithms to ensure model robustness.

Construction and validation of a Nomogram diagnostic model based on multi-omics biomarkers.

Key findings:

Five diagnostic feature genes (VASP, PIP4K2A, RRP36, METTL7A, AP2M1) were identified.

The Nomogram model achieved an AUC of 0.964 in an external cohort.

RRP36 and PIP4K2A emerged as potential mechanistic drivers of AD pathogenesis, implicating roles in cytoskeletal remodeling, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction.

This repository provides scripts, processed data matrices, and reproducible workflows to facilitate future biomarker discovery and precision intervention research in neurodegenerative diseases.
